.SH NAME
mudecode - MIME / UU decoder
.SH SYNOPSIS
mudecode
.RB [ -v ]
.RB [ -o
.IR destdir ]
.RI [ file
.IR ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B mudecode
decodes one or more files that were encoded by
.B uuencode
or
.BR mimeencode .
.LP
The uuencode file format is truly horrible.  No checksum or other
error detection.  Expands the file more than it needs to.  Multiple
barely-compatible versions.  But it's
in widespread use, so we may as well make the best uudecoder we can.
.LP
The MIME base64 format isn't actually that much better, since it also
lacks error detection.  But at least there's only one version of it.
So far.
.LP
This decoder will handle multiple input and output files,
automatically ignoring any intervening header and trailer lines.
You can decode a whole Usenet spool directory with a very simple
command.  For example:
.nf
    cd /usr/spool/news/alt/binaries/pictures/spam
    mudecode -v -o ~/tmp *
.fi
Only problem with this is is doesn't handle articles that arrived
out of order.
To fix that you can use the date_order program:
.nf
    mudecode -v -o ~/tmp `date_order *`
.fi
This is still not perfect, due to missing articles and parts that
were actually posted out of order, but it will correctly decode
maybe 95% of the pictures in the spool.
